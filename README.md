# Giftstar 2.0
An app for creating the perfect wish list for any occasion.

# The story
Giftstar (originally Gifts in the Gazebo) was an idea I came up with when two of my closest friends got engaged while I was in coding bootcamp. I felt it would be a good way to showcase what I had learned as well as help them (and others) out with a very important and sometimes difficult task.

The original app was hosted as a free dyno on Heroku; however, Heroku no longer has free dynos, and as a bootcamp project, the original app wasn't exactly my best work.

Now, with a bit of industry expereince behind me, I'm hoping to make this more powerful than it originally was.

# How it works

This is an application for creating wish lists for just about any occasion - weddings, baby showers, birthday parties, you name it.
